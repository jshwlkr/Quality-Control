Quality Control is a WordPress theme originally built by Spencer Finnell (https://github.com/spencerfinnell) back around 2010. While it was originally released under an open source license it later found it's way to AppThemes as a paid product. This repository represents an old version I found sitting in an old backup of mine. As far as I can tell the original source of the Quality Control theme is no longer public. I'm uploading this theme as a curiosity. The source code of this theme hasn't been updated since 2010 **it should not be used in production**.
